Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
ANSWER: Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a large software system into smaller, independent modules or components, each with a specific responsibility and well-defined interfaces. This approach aims to:
(a) Reduce complexity by dividing the system into manageable parts
(b) Increase reusability by allowing modules to be used in other contexts
(c) Enhance maintainability by making it easier to update or replace individual modules without affecting the entire system
(d) Improve scalability by enabling the addition of new modules or components as needed
         Modularity improves maintainability and scalability in several ways:
(a) Easier bug isolation and fixing.
(b) Reduced ripple effect (changes in one module don't impact the entire system).
(c) Faster development and deployment of new features.
(d) Improved code reuse.
(e) Simplified system understanding and navigation.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
ANSWER: Software testing involves evaluating software to ensure it meets requirements, works as expected, and is free from defects. There are different levels of testing, each with its own objectives:
(a) Unit Testing: Tests individual software components (units) to ensure they function correctly.
(b) Integration Testing: Tests how multiple units work together to ensure seamless integration.
(c) System Testing: Tests the entire software system to ensure it meets requirements and works as expected.
